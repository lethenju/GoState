# state_machine
A simple framework for designing state machines in Go

## What is it ?

You like to design state machines but you dont want to waste time with the implementation ? 
This project aim to answer your needs and provide an easy way to design your state machines based programs very easily.

## Cool ! How can I use it

I'm currently writing a guide, but for now you can simply open the fizzbuzz example to see how to declare your states and connections and callbacks before running the state machine

## Meh it seems super boring and full of boilerplate code

Yeah I know ! I'm currently working on a tool to generate automatically the go code from a representation (plantuml maybe?) of a state diagram
